## Basic concept

In order to better understand the content of this article, we need to first understand the following basic concepts.

### Flexbox container
Flexbox containers, also known as elastic containers, are generated by setting display: flex. A simple example is as follows:

``````
.container{
    display:flex
}
``````

### Flexbox items (flexbox items)

When an element is set as a flexbox container, its immediate child elements will automatically become container members, also known as: flexbox items.

Note: Because the flexbox layout occurs between the parent element and the child element, the flexbox container is uniformly referred to as the "parent container" for the convenience of the text, and the flexbox item is uniformly referred to as the "child element"

### Remaining space

Remaining space refers to the unallocated space left by the parent container in the direction of the main axis. It is a very important word in the flexbox layout. We can better understand it with the help of the following example:

[![piZsMF0.md.png](https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/27/piZsMF0.md.png)](https://imgse.com/i/piZsMF0)


In the above code, we define a parent container container with a width of 600px, and child elements item1 and item2 with a width of 200px, then we get that the remaining space is 200px, and the calculation formula is:

Free space = width of parent container - width of item1 - width of item2


### Free space allocation related properties

Child elements in the flexbox layout can change the size of the space they are allocated to by setting the flex property. Flex properties include flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-shrink


 #### flex-basis

 Flex-basis is used to define the default width or height of child elements. If the direction of the parent container's flex-direction property is horizontal, it is width, and if it is vertical, it is height. Equivalent to setting the width or height of the child element. If the property and width or height are set at the same time, the property weight is greater than the value of width or height.

 #### flex-grow

 Flex-grow is used to specify the allocation ratio of excess space in the parent container. The default value is 0. Seeing this, you may still have no idea. To understand more vividly, let's take a look at the following example.

 Example: only set the flex-grow of item1 to 1

 [![piZsQYV.md.png](https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/27/piZsQYV.md.png)](https://imgse.com/i/piZsQYV)

 The CSS code is as follows:

 [![piZslWT.md.png](https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/27/piZslWT.md.png)](https://imgse.com/i/piZslWT)

 Here, after we set flex-grow: 1 to item1, we can see that the width of the space occupied by item1 becomes 400px, which means that item1 occupies the remaining 200px space of the parent container we mentioned before.

 Here we can draw: In fact, flex-grow defines how to allocate the remaining space of the parent container. When the value is 0, the child elements will not claim the remaining space of the parent container. When item1 sets flex-grow: 1, since item2 does not set the value of flex-grow, the remaining space will be divided into one and divided into item1.

 Example: Set the flex-grow of item1 to 1 and the flex-grow of item2 to 3

 If we set the flex-grow: 3 of item2 at this time, item2 will also participate in obtaining the remaining space of the parent container. At this time, the remaining space of the parent container will be divided into 4 parts, then 1 part will be allocated to item1, and 3 parts will be allocated to item2, as shown below:

 [![piZs3SU.md.png](https://z1.ax1x.com/2023/10/27/piZs3SU.md.png)](https://imgse.com/i/piZs3SU)

 Flex-grow will not take effect if the sum of the widths of the child elements exceeds the parent container.

 In the above example, we only consider the case where the sum of the widths of the child elements does not exceed the width of the parent container, then it can use flex-grow to allocate the remaining space of the parent container. So when the sum of the widths of the child elements exceeds the width of the parent container, can the remaining space be allocated at this time? Is flex-grow still valid at this time? Let's take a look at the following example first:

 Here we set the width of item1 and item2 in the above example to 350px, then the sum of the widths of the child elements is 700px and exceeds the 600px width of the parent container.

 ![flex5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdullA-Ababakre/blog_images/main/tech/css/flex/flex5.png)

 We can see that flex-grow doesn't work, and the width of the two items is compressed to only 300px.

 Through the method of how to calculate the remaining space learned before, we can calculate that the remaining space in this example is 600px - 700px or -100px. Here it can be concluded that since there is no remaining space, the child elements that define flex-grow can be allocated to The space is 0, so it does not take effect. In addition, what we need to know is that the width 600px of the parent container of the flexbox environment will not change due to the total width of the child elements, that is, the sum of the widths of the child elements is at most equal to the width of the parent container, so in order to make the child elements fully displayed in the parent container, there are only two ways:


 - Wrap child elements by setting flex-wrap
- by compressing child elements so that they can be housed in the parent container

flex-shrink
Flex-shrink is used to specify the reduction ratio of child elements when the parent container space is not enough, the default is 1. If the flex-shrink attribute of a flexbox item is 0, the element will not be compressed.

Why do you need flex-shrink to define the reduction ratio?

As we can see above, when the sum of the widths of the child elements is greater than the width of the parent container of the flexbox, the remaining space will be negative. If no newline is set, it will compress the child elements to be accommodated in the parent container. So how do we control the compression ratio of child elements? The answer is by setting the flex-shrink property.

Example: Set the flex-shrink of the item

In the following example, we set the width of two items to 350px, while the width of the container container is still 600px. At the same time, the flex-shrink properties of item1 and item2 are defined as 1 and 4 respectively. As follows:

![flex6](https://github.com/AbdullA-Ababakre/blog_images/blob/main/tech/css/flex/flex6.png?raw=true)

The code is as follows:

![flex7](https://github.com/AbdullA-Ababakre/blog_images/blob/main/tech/css/flex/flex7.png?raw=true)

We see that due to the lack of 100px space, the missing 100px will be divided into 5 parts according to the flex-shrink values defined by item1 and item2. Item1 will compress 1/5 of it, which is 20px, and item2 will compress 4/5 of it, which is 80px.

Example: Set the flex-shrink of the item to 0

In the above knowledge, we learned that the default value of flex-shrink is 1, that is, the default child element will be compressed when the parent container space is insufficient. Now let's set the project's flex-shrink to 0 to see if it is not compressed. As follows:

![flex8](https://github.com/AbdullA-Ababakre/blog_images/blob/main/tech/css/flex/flex8.png?raw=true)

The code is as follows:
